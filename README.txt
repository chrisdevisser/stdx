This is a set of C++ utilities implemented using only the standard headers. Boost is a slight possibility if something would really benefit from it. All headers have a .hh extension. This is very reliant on C++11 and will become more reliant on C++14 as more features become available.

I aim for a clean build with at least -Wall, -Wextra, and -pedantic.
